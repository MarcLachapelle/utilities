C structure to generate a custom pit file. Special thanks to Hexabit for sharing 
the information about this and providing the source files.
Don't use this if you don't know what you are doing,
this surely can BRICK YOUR DEVICE to an unrecoverable state.

         **** check you layout twice before you flash it! ****

HOW TO:

   arm-none-linux-gcc -c <source file>.c
   
   arm-none-linux-objcopy -O binary <source file>.o <source file>.pit
   
   flash it with heimdall
